# üêö Introduction to Shell Scripting

Shell scripts are text files containing a series of commands for the Unix/Linux shell to execute. They automate repetitive tasks, simplify system administration, and can combine multiple commands into a single executable file.

## üìÑ Basic Structure

A shell script usually starts with a shebang (`#!`) line to specify the interpreter:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment
echo "Hello, World!"
```

- `#!/bin/bash` tells the system to use the Bash shell.
- Lines starting with `#` are comments.

   ```
2. **Make it executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x myscript.sh
   ```
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   ./myscript.sh
   ```
